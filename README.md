This is the Envoy used in the EGW.  

It bootstraps its config from the container filesystem at the standard location: /etc/envoy/envoy.yaml.

The container includes some basic stuff for troubleshooting networking not found in the containers from envoy

Note: the container registry is private, you will need to authenticate
